The year was 2089. The world was divided into two blocs: the Chinese Empire and the United States of America. The former had conquered most of Asia, Africa and Europe, while the latter had retreated to its eastern coast, clinging to its old allies and values. In between them lay a vast wasteland, where law and order had collapsed after decades of war and environmental disasters. This was the Badlands, a place where only the brave, the desperate or the foolish dared to venture.

Lee was all three. He was a detective, or at least he liked to call himself that. He lived in Junk Town, a sprawling metropolis built from the scraps of civilization along the Missouri River. It was a city of contrasts: neon lights and dark alleys, skyscrapers and shanties, casinos and slums. It was a city of opportunity: for smugglers, hackers, mercenaries and spies. And it was a city of danger: for anyone who crossed the wrong people or asked too many questions.

Lee had a knack for doing both. He was half-Chinese, half-American, which made him an outsider in both worlds. He had inherited his father's sharp eyes and his mother's stubborn chin. He had also inherited their sense of justice and curiosity, which often got him into trouble. He worked as a private investigator for anyone who could afford his services: corporations, gangs, rebels or refugees. He didn't care much about politics or loyalty; he only cared about solving cases and getting paid.

But his latest case was different. It involved a mysterious woman named Jade, who had hired him to find her missing brother. She said he was a journalist who had gone undercover in New Shanghai, the capital of the Chinese occupation zone in California. She said he had uncovered something big: a secret plot that could change the course of history.

Lee didn't believe her at first; he thought she was just another dame with a sob story and a hidden agenda. But he took the job anyway; he needed the money and he liked the challenge.

He soon regretted it.

He followed her brother's trail across the Badlands: from Junk Town to Kansas City to Denver to Salt Lake City to Las Vegas to Los Angeles to New Shanghai.

He encountered all kinds of dangers along the way: bandits
and bounty hunters; drones and landmines; radiation storms
and mutant beasts.

He also encountered all kinds of clues along
the way: encrypted messages
and coded maps; hidden cameras
and secret contacts; fake IDs
and forged documents.

He pieced them together like a puzzle,
slowly revealing
a picture that shocked him:

A picture of an imminent nuclear war.

Lee checked his gun and his watch. He had five minutes left before the train arrived. He hoped he was not too late.

He was standing on the platform of the Junk Town Central Station, surrounded by a crowd of people. Some were travelers, looking for a way out of this hellhole. Some were traders, looking for a way to make a profit. Some were spies, looking for a way to gather information.

Lee was none of those. He was a detective, looking for a way to solve a case.

He scanned the faces around him, searching for his target. He had only seen her picture once: a young woman with long black hair and green eyes. Her name was Jade, and she had hired him to find her missing brother.

She said he was a journalist who had gone undercover in New Shanghai, the capital of the Chinese occupation zone in California. She said he had uncovered something big: a secret plot that could change the course of history.

She said she had received his last message two days ago: "I have it. Meet me at Junk Town Central Station on Friday at noon. Train 17. Car 3. Seat 12."

She said she needed Lee's help to get him out safely.

Lee didn't believe her at first; he thought she was just another dame with a sob story and a hidden agenda. But he took the job anyway; he needed the money and he liked the challenge.

He regretted it now.

He didn't know who was behind it or why they wanted it,
but he knew he had to stop it.
And he knew he had to find Jade's brother before it was too late.

He checked his watch again.
Four minutes left.
The train would be here soon.
And so would trouble.





Chapter 1

The rain was falling hard on Junk Town, the city that never sleeps. It was a place where anything goes and nothing matters. A place where you could find anything you wanted, for a price. A place where the law was a joke and the only rule was survival.

John was sitting in his office, smoking a cigarette and drinking whiskey. He was a detective, one of the few who still cared about justice in this godforsaken land. He had seen it all: murder, rape, robbery, kidnapping, torture. He had seen the horrors of war and the atrocities of the invaders. He had seen the corruption and decay of his own government and people. He had seen enough to make him cynical and bitter, but not enough to make him quit.

He looked at the clock on the wall. It was almost midnight. He had no clients, no leads, no cases. He wondered why he bothered to keep his office open at all. Maybe he was hoping for something to happen, something to break the monotony of his life. Maybe he was just too stubborn to give up.

He heard a knock on the door. He got up from his desk and walked over to it. He opened it slightly and saw a woman standing outside. She was young and beautiful, with long blonde hair and blue eyes. She wore a red dress that hugged her curves and a black coat that covered her shoulders.

"Are you John?" she asked in a sweet voice.

"That's me," he said gruffly.

"Can I come in?" she asked.

"Sure," he said.

He opened the door wider and let her in. She walked past him into his office and sat down on a chair opposite his desk.

He closed the door behind him and went back to his desk.

"What can I do for you?" he asked.

She looked at him with an expression of fear and desperation.

"I need your help," she said.
